## Coding Challenge 3
---
Aceng and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 diffrent restaurants.
The bills were $124, $48, and $268. To tip the waiter a fair amount, Aceng created a simple tip calculator (as a function). He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.

in the end, Aceng would like to have 2 arrays:
1. containing all three tips (one for each bill)
2. containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip).

(NOTE: to calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply if with 20/200 = 0.2)
