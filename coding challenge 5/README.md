## Coding Challenge 5

this time, Aceng and his family went to 5 different restaurants. the bills were $124, $48, $268, $180, and $42.
Aceng likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.

implement a tip calculator using objects and loop:

1. create an object with an array for the bill values
2. add a method to calculate the tip
3. this method should include a loop to iterate over all the paid bills and do the tip calculations
4. as an output, create 
* a new array containing all tips
* an array containing final paid amounts (bill + tip). HINT: start with two empty arrays[] as properties and then fill them up in the loop.
